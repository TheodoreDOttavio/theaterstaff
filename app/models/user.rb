    #this is a test for memmory objects, not database entries so a double submit will still create two entries that are the same
    #  need to implement at the database level as well

    #  also for uniqueness, downcase the email before saving it to the db
  before_save { self.email = email.downcase }

  #For User Tokens, adds one before the user create route is triggered:
  before_create :create_remember_token

  validates :name, presence: true, length: { maximum: 50 }

  #study regex here: http://www.rubular.com/
  VALID_EMAIL_REGEX = /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i

  #uniqueness: true works, but it is not sensitive to case... so:
  validates :email, presence: true, format: { with: VALID_EMAIL_REGEX },
    uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false }

    #to add password and password_confirmation attributes, require the presence of
    #  the password, require that they match, and add an authenticate method to
    #  compare a hashed password to the password_digest to authenticate users.
    #  This is the only nontrivial step, and in the latest version of Rails
    #  all these features come for free with one method, has_secure_password:

    has_secure_password
    validates :password, length: { minimum: 6 }

  # the next two methods are left public so they can be used elsewhere
