Get out of Ruby 1.9
DONE - now on Ruby 2.1.7. Test on Heroku, and resent my lack of rspec tests :( Lesson Learned!

performances show has a PG grouping error

Rip out Distributeds controller and implement it with a hash based model object

Data Archive
  Save to db directory for db:seed Heroku 8k Distributed
    or create a csv data model?
  Save users with passwords intact
    A custom archive that uses users.create?
  Modify Scan filenames when there is a cutoff Date

Users
  Save a signature snapstot

Distributeds
  add available - an infrared distributed with rep_id and qty 0

Data Entry
  two partials for infrared and special services
  check the next week, if no data, add infrared at qty 0

Paperwork and Reports
  Very slow - revise to show a ywl file and update it at data enrty
  @object for the select tags... it's nil, doesn't work without it. Need to grok this.

TESTING!!!
  get basic tests back in and continue with TDD

And keep checking:
rails_best_practices . -f html
  The xls sheets make 50+/56 errors. Make a class in models to generate them.
