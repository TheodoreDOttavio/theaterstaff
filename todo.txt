Get out of Ruby 1.9
DONE - now on Ruby 2.1.7. Test on Heroku, and resent my lack of rspec tests :( Lesson Learned!

performances show has a PG grouping error

Rip out Distributeds controller and implement it with a hash based model object

Data Archive
  Save to db directory for db:seed Heroku 8k Distributed
    or create a csv data model?
  Save users with passwords intact
    A custom archive that uses users.create?
  Modify Scan filenames when there is a cutoff Date

Users
  Save a signature snapstot

Distributeds
  add available - an infrared distributed with rep_id

Data Entry
  two partials for infrared and special services
  Add an option to plaster rep over all the TBD's that have quantity (default rep) for the week

Paperwork and Reports
  Very slow - revise to show a ywl file and update it at data enrty
  @object for the select tags... it's nil, doesn't work without it. Need to grok this.

TESTING!!!
  get basic tests back in and continue with TDD

And keep checking:
